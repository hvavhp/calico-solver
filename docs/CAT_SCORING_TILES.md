### Calico — Cat Scoring Tiles Reference

This reference lists every cat scoring tile used in Calico, including the cat’s name, the required pattern group size or exact shape, and the points awarded. For each game, three cat tiles are selected and each is assigned two allowed patterns during setup. All groups/shapes must be contiguous (edge-adjacent) and composed entirely of tiles with one of that cat’s two allowed patterns.

Notes:
- “Group size” cats score for a contiguous group of at least the stated size (no specific shape beyond contiguity).
- “Shape” cats score for an exact arrangement (orientation can vary by rotation/flip on the hex grid, but the arrangement must match).
- When you complete a qualifying group/shape, take the highest-value remaining token for that cat and place it on one tile in the group. In practice, all tokens for a given cat show the same value for that cat.

- **Cira**
  - Requirement: Group of ≥ 6 tiles (same pattern)
  - Points: 9

  - Requirement: Group of ≥ 7 tiles (same pattern)
  - Points: 11

### Shape-based cats (exact shapes in one pattern)

- **Callie**
  - Requirement: Triangle of 3 tiles (two adjacent tiles above and one centered directly below them)
  - Points: 3

- **Rumi**
  - Requirement: Straight line of 3 tiles
  - Points: 5

- **Tecolote**
  - Requirement: Straight line of 4 tiles
  - Points: 7

- **Almond**
  - Requirement: 5-tile "T" shape (row of 3 with a 2-tile row centered above)
  - Points: 9

- **Leo**
  - Requirement: Straight line of 5 tiles
  - Points: 11

### Additional details

- Allowed patterns: Each cat tile is assigned two allowed patterns during setup; qualifying groups/shapes must consist exclusively of tiles in one of those two patterns.
- Distinct claims: You may claim the same cat multiple times if you form multiple distinct qualifying groups/shapes (not edge-connected to each other).
- Interaction with other scoring: Cat groups/shapes are independent of button color groups and design goal arrangements; a placed tile can contribute to both a cat claim and button/design scoring simultaneously.

### Difficulty groups (dot groups) and setup selection

Cat scoring tiles are organized into 3 difficulty groups, indicated by the number of dots on the tile. During setup, select one tile from each dot group (3 tiles total), then choose which side of each tile to use. Assign two allowed patterns to each selected tile.

- One-dot (easiest) — 1 tile:
  - Double-sided tile: Millie (≥3 group, 3 pts) / Callie (triangle of 3, 3 pts)
  - Double-sided tile: Tibbit (≥4 group, 5 pts) / Rumi (line of 3, 5 pts)

- Two-dot (medium) — 2 tiles:
  - Double-sided tile: Coconut (≥5 group, 7 pts) / Tecolote (line of 4, 7 pts)
  - Double-sided tile: Cira (≥6 group, 9 pts) / Almond (T shape of 5, 9 pts)

- Three-dot (hardest) — 2 tiles:
  - Double-sided tile: Gwenivere (≥7 group, 11 pts) / Leo (line of 5, 11 pts)

Notes:
- “Choose a side” means you’ll use either the size-based requirement or the shape-based requirement printed on that tile for the entire game.
- The two allowed patterns for each selected tile are assigned at setup using the black & white pattern markers.
